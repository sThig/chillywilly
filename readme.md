# :penguin: CHILLY WILLY

I'm teaching myself some CSS stuff, some things are good some things are hard.  I'm learning more about nth childs and how to position stuff better.

# TIL
* I wrote out part of this on my own (but still had to refer back to the code pen)
* Big props to _CAPTAIN ANONYMOUS_ for his [fat little penguin Code Pen](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Nprgez)
* nth child is fun, and super userful
* I feel like I could make the wings flap with js, I may revist things
* I learned how to put emojis in README.MD :bowtie:
